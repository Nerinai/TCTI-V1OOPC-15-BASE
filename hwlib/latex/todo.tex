Known issue

Nice to haves
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item character console on graphics
\item rectangle (filled), circle (filled), image (external converter)
\item graphics 2"4 L\+CD
\item targets\+: Pi, Liliypad85
\item A\+D\+S1115
\item L\+C\+D/button shield
\item due adc
\item use and provide ranges (instead of x, y for loops)
\item time-\/based wait (or at least a now() function)
\item listener pattern \textquotesingle{}dummy\textquotesingle{} pins?
\item pcf8591
\item block-\/write for graphics
\item faster I2C by exposing the elements, use in oled?
\end{DoxyItemize}

Quality \& consistency issues
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item main() not (void)
\item file-\/local objects are not documented? (check ostream)
\item author \& change date everywhere?
\item \hyperlink{namespacedb103}{db103} align pin classes
\item more examples (graphics, ...)
\item lcd5510 should use S\+PI??
\item i2c example of address-\/only write
\item directories opschonen
\item make full build, clean
\item test for input, output, oc, analog pins of a chip
\item rewrite text for uno (due?) IO pins
\item foto for setups, eg. hc595 (pins!!)
\item run does not recompile on changed main.\+cpp??
\item test that all headers can compile {\itshape individually}
\item rename lcd to something that includes oled
\item cleanup oled =$>$ ssd1306, provide init code, expose command interface
\end{DoxyItemize}

Must test
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item H\+D44780 other sizes
\end{DoxyItemize}

Doxygen issues
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item alphabetical index??
\item prevent /// -\/ in file listing?
\item ostream\+::showos \textquotesingle{}functions\textquotesingle{} have no \textquotesingle{}More..." ??
\item ostream members are listed as related??
\end{DoxyItemize}

The list of issues, plans, bugs, etc\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item add an I2C temp sensor for Leo of iets anders
\item I2C read, pcf8574a, demo\+: copy 1 to 2
\item one\+\_\+pin trick =$>$ defines.\+hpp
\item use an abstraction instead of copied code in the extenders one\+\_\+pin =$>$ pin\+\_\+out\+\_\+through\+\_\+buffer
